<h2>Homage to catalonia</h2>
<p>
<strong>Homage to Catalonia</strong> is <a href="1.html"> George Orwell's</a> <u>personal account of his experiences and observations</u> fighting for the POUM militia of the Republican army during the Spanish Civil War. The war was one of the defining events of his political outlook and a significant part of what led him to write in 1946, "Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for Democratic Socialism, as I understand it."
